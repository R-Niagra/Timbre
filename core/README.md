# Core
This package implements the Timbre blockchain and related functionalities, such as `blockpool` which is a cache for blocks that are ereceived from the network but cannot be directly added to the blockchain yet.

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), the consensus mechanism used by Timbre, and other on-chain mechanisms such as transactions and balance computations, should also be implemented in this package.
